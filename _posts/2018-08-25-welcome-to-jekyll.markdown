This is the first post on HLS (High-Level Synthesis) blog. Most of the posts will be about FPGA, HLS and GPU. 
Following is a snipped of a code to test. 

{% highlight C %}
void hls_hello_world(int array[])
  for(int i=0;i<10;i++) {
    arr[i] = arr[i]*2;  
  }

#=> Multiply the every element of an array by 2.
{% endhighlight %}

And some random stuff,..
