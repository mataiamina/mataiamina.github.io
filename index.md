I work on AI/ML at AMD. Previously, I was with Qualcomm AI Research, and I worked in several interesting and interrelated areas. My primary goal is to make computer vision/machine learning workloads efficient either by designing hardware accelerators or 
making the models more efficient. I also teach at University of California, San Diego for Master of Advanced Studies Program. You can find more about Master of Advanced Studies program here:  https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/mas/faculty-staff  

# Currently I work on following areas:

* Full stack machine learning: HW-SW co-design for low power machine learning (full stack optimization of ML from model to hardware level. Full stack optimization: Quantization, model level optimization, graph level optimization, hardware level optimization) 
* Efficient large language models (mostly focused on the state space models and hybrid self-attention)
* Emerging AI workloads (LLMs, 3D vision, 3D sparse convolution) on edge devices.  
* Collaborated extensively with Universities ([UCSD Visual Computing Center](http://visualcomputing.ucsd.edu/), Cornell and many other universities. You can find some of the projects as a result of these collaborations from here.

In the past, I worked on ML compilers (mainly TVM-based), and I also briefly worked on MLIR. 
  

# Previous work  
Previously, I was a Principal Software engineer at the 3D Engineering department of [Cognex Corporation](https://www.cognex.com/), and I have worked on following areas: 
* FPGA acceleration of computer vision algorithms 
* End to end design of binary neural network on the FPGA  

I contributed to the high speed DSMAX product line of Cognex which can be found here:  [DSMAX 3D LASER DISPLACEMENT SENSOR](https://www.cognex.com/videos/3d-sensors/dsmax-3d-laser-displacement-sensor)



# Parallel Programming for FPGAs Book  
* Parallel Programming for FPGAs which I contributed (developed most of labs and demos) is used by many Universities around the world starting from UCSD, Cornell, UT Austin, UC Berkeley,..and many others.  
* This book has nice tutorial/demo page here: [Parallel Programming for FPGAs](https://pp4fpgas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 

***Academic life:*** I completed my PhD in Computer Science from the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) department of [UCSD](https://www.ucsd.edu). I was a Masters's student at ICU (Information and Communications University) which is now part of [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/index.html). 
I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [Mongolian University of Science and Technology](http://www.must.edu.mn/eng/). 
Other than my current job, I occasionally teach at the Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of California San Diego as a lecturer and an adjunct professor. A long time ago I was in South Korea where I worked for [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri) as a researcher for a couple of years. 

My general interests are applications of hw acceleration of ML (LLMs, Transformers, 3D, deep earning, ML), tinyML, ML-based ISP, and computer vision, deep learning compilers.  
I am also interested in computer architecture, parallel programming and ML compilers
